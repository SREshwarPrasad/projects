__*About:*__

This project focuses on Paddy Leaf Disease Classification using both Deep Learning 
and Machine Learning techniques. The dataset consists of multiple disease categories 
such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, blast, tungro, hispa, and more. Each folder 
contains image samples of the corresponding disease type.

A CNN model is implemented for image-based deep learning classification, while traditional 
ML models such as SVM-PCA, Random Forest, and K-LDA are also included for comparison. 
The dataset is organized into separate folders for each disease class, along with a 
balanced dataset and COCO-format annotations. The goal of this project is to provide 
efficient models that can help identify rice plant diseases early using leaf images.
